<!-- Brief project description -->
<p align="center">Water allocation problems necessitate the equitable distribution of finite water resources among competing users. These issues are frequently framed as optimization problems, requiring the allocation of multiple water sources across diverse users while adhering to various constraints. We propose to formulate water allocation problem as a Qudratic Assignement Problem that we will reduce to a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization problem to make it compatible with quantum computing.</p>

## About

A Python project that optimizes water allocation to from different sources to different users of uses using quantum computing. The goal is to minimize environmental, social and economical cost of water scarcity while considering specific users parameters and constraints.
